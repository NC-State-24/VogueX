## Error 403: Forbidden on POST Requests

**Description**: This error occurs when the server denies permission for a POST request, often due to misconfigurations in permissions or authentication settings.

### Troubleshooting & Resolution
1. **Check CSRF Token**: If CSRF protection is enabled, include the token in your POST request.
   ```html
   <input type="hidden" name="csrfmiddlewaretoken" value="{{ csrf_token }}">
   ```
2. Verify Permissions: Ensure the request has the necessary permissions.
3. Check API Endpoint Access: Confirm the API endpoint URL is correct and accessible.
4. Review Server Configurations: Inspect configuration files (e.g., nginx or apache2) to ensure POST requests are permitted.

## Merge Conflicts while committing changes
Description: Occurs when attempting to commit with unmerged files from a previous merge conflict.

Troubleshooting & Resolution
List Unmerged Files:
bash
```
git status
```
Resolve Conflicts: Open conflicted files, look for conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>), and edit as needed.
Stage Resolved Files:
bash
```
git add <file>
```
Commit the Changes:
```
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```
